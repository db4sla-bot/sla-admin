# Payment Installment Feature Documentation

## Overview
The CustomerDetails component now supports **installment-based payment tracking**. This allows you to create payment records for work and then track multiple installment payments against each record.

---

## How It Works

### Two-Step Process:

#### 1. **Create Payment Record**
First, create a payment record for the work:
- Select the work
- Enter total work amount
- Save the record

This creates a payment record with:
- Total amount for the work
- Empty installments array
- Creation timestamp

#### 2. **Add Installments**
Then, add payments received as installments:
- Click "Add Installment" button
- Select the payment record
- Enter amount received
- Select payment date and mode
- Add optional notes
- Save installment

- **Work Title** - Which work this payment is for
- **Payment Status Badge** - Visual indicator:
  - 🟢 **Paid** - Full amount received (green)
  - 🟡 **Partial** - Some amount received (yellow/orange)
  - 🔴 **Pending** - No payment received yet (red)
- **Total Amount** - Total work amount
- **Amount Paid** - Sum of all installments

### Installment History:
